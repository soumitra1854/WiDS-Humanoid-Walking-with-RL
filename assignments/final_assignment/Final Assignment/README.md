# Humanoid Walking Simulation
We settled for 2D simulation due to the sheer complexity of a 3D simulation, nevertheless the core would be the same.

Decide on a suitable reward function and implement it, you can play around with different versions of the reward function and see how your model plays out so that you may get few ideas.

The metrics of this project would be a screen recorded video of the simulation, a write up on the implemented reward function, and finally the code.

## Instructions

1. **Install Required Modules**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Check Pygame Installation**:
    ```sh
    python3 simulation.py
    ```

3. **Train the Model**:
    ```sh
    python3 model.py train
    ```

4. **Load and Test the Model**:
    ```sh
    python3 model.py load
    ```

5. **Modify the Model**:
    - Feel free to make changes to `model.py` if you want to use a different model.

6. **Implement Reward Function**:
    - You need to write the `_compute_reward` function in `humanoid_env_rl.py`.
    - Train and test the model after implementing the reward function.

7. **Additional Information**:
    - Go through the code and terminal outputs to understand the dimensions and any other information required to write the reward function.
